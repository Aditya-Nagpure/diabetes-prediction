# Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical features. The dataset used is inspired by the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Features Used
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age in years

## ðŸ“Š Model Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that finds the best hyperplane to separate diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
